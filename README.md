# odin-private-events

Created as part of the Odin Project:

[Project specification here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-on-rails-private-events)

The app implements all of the requested functionality with the exception of the final 'extra credit' (make events private and invite attendees via email).

Users can:

- Register for the app
- Sign in and out
- Update their account details
- Create events, edit their own events, and delete their own events (removing all associated registrations in the process)
- Register to attend an event (including their own) and cancel their registration
- View lists of created, upcoming (registered) and past (registered) events
- Navigate the site using the Navbar

Bare-bones styling with Bootstrap.
